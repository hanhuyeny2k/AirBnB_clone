# AirBnB Clone - The Console
The obective of the console project is to create our own data model, manage objects via a console acts as a command interpreter and store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

## What Is A Command Interpreter?
This is how we manage the objects of our project:
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object
